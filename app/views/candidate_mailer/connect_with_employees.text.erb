Have you networked and talked to people who work(ed) for <%= @opp.employer.name %>?

* Use your LinkedIn and Facebook connections to reach out to people who work(ed) at the company you're aiming for.
* Introduce yourself, attach a resume, and ask them: "What is it like to work there? What does the interview look like? Do you think I'll be a good fit for the company and the role?"
* If it sounds like you're a good fit, ask for a referral: "Would you be willing to refer me internally?"
* PRO TIP: Keep taking feedback and revise your application materials accordingly.
