<ul class="tips">
  <li>Look through the job posting and anything else you've gotten from this employer so far for info on how the interview process works.</li>
  <li>Use online search, social media (including LinkedIn) and your network: What is the life story of the hiring manager(s) / interviewer(s)? Where did they go to school and what did they study? Do they have a blog or published work online or in print? If so, what are their interests and opinions? Were they mentioned in news stories? Are they active on online forums?</li>
  <li>Brainstorm what questions they might ask based on what you've learned about them.</li>
  <li>PRO TIP: Research what people wear on the actual job so you can dress appropriately for your interview.</li>
