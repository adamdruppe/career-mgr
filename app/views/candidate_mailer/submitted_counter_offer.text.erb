Have you submitted a counter offer to <%= @opp.employer.name %>?

* Give yourself a pat on the back and celebrate! You've made it this far, regardless of whether you'll end up agreeing on the terms.
* Get advice on negotiating your salary and benefits package: Consult mentors and other people in your network, as well as sites like glassdoor.com and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to assess the offer you received.
* PRO TIP: The offer you get won't always be a fair one. If it's too low (based on your research), propose a counter-offer that's a little better than you'd expect to end up with and let them counter it.
